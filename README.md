## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm Robson Silva, a Computer Technician graduated from the National Service for Industrial Training - SENAI, specialized in the area of ​​Programming and Systems Development. I specialized in the Delphi/Pascal programming language and in Database development and administration in the SQL language, in which I have a lot of experience. I also recently specialized in the Python programming language, in which I am fully dedicating myself in the area of ​​Data Analysis and Science with a solid foundation in its various data analysis and visualization tools and libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, Scikit-Learn and Jupyter Notebook. I have a passion for data and SQL and discovered in Python a talent for discovering complex data insights and applying machine learning to solve real-world problems. This GitHub page serves as a showcase and portfolio of my projects, skills and continuous learning journey.
